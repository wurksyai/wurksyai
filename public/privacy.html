        <h1>Privacy notice</h1>
        <p class="muted">Last updated: 27 November 2025</p>
        <p>
          This privacy notice explains how Wurksy AI collects, uses and protects
          personal data when you use the Wurksy AI web application and related
          services (the “Service”).
        </p>
        <p>
          When Wurksy AI is provided to you through a university or college,
          that institution will usually be the
          <strong>data controller</strong>. Wurksy AI then acts as a
          <strong>data processor</strong> on their behalf. For those
          deployments, you should also read your institution’s own privacy
          notice.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Who we are and how to contact us</h2>
        <p>
          Wurksy AI is currently developed and operated in the United Kingdom by
          its creator (the “Operator”). For institutional deployments, the
          university or college that licenses Wurksy AI will normally be the
          organisation responsible for your data.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any questions about this notice or how your data is used,
          you can contact:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            <strong>Email:</strong>
            <a href="mailto:info@wurksyai.com">info@wurksyai.com</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Or via your university’s usual data protection or IT service
            channels when Wurksy AI is deployed by your institution.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>What this notice covers</h2>
        <p>This notice applies to:</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>The Wurksy AI web application and admin interface.</li>
          <li>
            Any support or helpdesk communication directly related to the
            Service.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It does not cover third party systems that Wurksy AI may integrate
          with, such as your university’s virtual learning environment (for
          example Blackboard, Moodle or similar). Those services have their own
          privacy notices.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Personal data we collect</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is designed to collect only the data needed to deliver a
          controlled AI “sandbox” and to support academic integrity checks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on how your institution configures the Service, we may
          process:
        </p>

        <h3>Account and identity details</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Name and institutional email address.</li>
          <li>Student or staff ID number.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Usage and session data</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            Session identifiers, timestamps, and information about which
            assignment a session relates to.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prompts and messages you enter into Wurksy AI and the AI responses
            returned.
          </li>
          <li>
            System events such as when sessions are created, locked, submitted
            or exported for staff review.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Content you provide</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            Text from assignment briefs that staff upload for use inside the
            Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lecture materials, notes or files that are uploaded so that Wurksy
            can answer questions about them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Research queries and metadata relating to research articles you
            choose to look up through the Service.

        </ul>

        <h3>Technical data</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>IP address and rough location derived from it.</li>
          <li>Browser type, device type and basic configuration details.</li>
          <li>

            reliable.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Special category data</h3>
        <p>
          Wurksy AI is not intended for processing special category data such as
          health information or details about your protected characteristics.
          Please avoid entering this type of information into the Service unless
          your institution specifically instructs you to do so and has a clear
          legal basis.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>How we use your data and legal bases</h2>
        <p>
          The exact legal basis will depend on how your institution deploys
          Wurksy AI. Typical legal bases under UK data protection law are:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            <strong>Public task</strong> – for universities carrying out their
            teaching, assessment and quality assurance responsibilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contract</strong> – to provide the Service to you where it
            is part of your learning or employment environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – to ensure fair assessment,
            maintain academic integrity, prevent misuse of AI tools and improve
            the Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent</strong> – only where you are clearly asked for and
            give your consent for a specific purpose.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We use your data to:</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Authenticate you and link sessions to the correct assignment.</li>
          <li>
            Enforce assignment specific AI rules, such as prompt caps and output
            limits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide AI assisted suggestions and summaries in line with the
            assignment policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Log AI usage and generate an AI Index file that can be attached to
            your assessment submission.
          </li>
          <li>
            Support staff in reviewing AI usage for academic integrity checks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Monitor usage levels, performance and security of the Service and
            plan capacity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Investigate and respond to misuse, technical incidents or suspected
            academic misconduct.

      <section class="card">
        <h2>AI providers and data sharing</h2>
        <p>
          Wurksy AI uses third party AI providers to generate responses to your
          prompts. These providers currently include OpenAI or Microsoft Azure
          OpenAI, depending on how your institution configures the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          We share only the text needed to generate a response, for example the
          prompt you entered, any relevant lecture extracts and system
          instructions. Where possible, we configure these providers so that:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            Your data is not used to train or improve their general models.
          </li>
          <li>Retention periods are limited to what is needed for security.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may also share data with:</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            Your university or college, including module leaders and academic
            integrity staff, so they can review AI usage linked to an
            assignment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Service providers that host our databases and infrastructure, such
            as Supabase and cloud hosting platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Professional advisers and regulators where required by law or to
            manage legal claims.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not sell your personal data and we do not use it for targeted
          advertising.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>International transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Some of our service providers may be located outside the United
          Kingdom. Where this is the case, we will take steps to ensure that
          appropriate safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual
          clauses approved under UK data protection law or use of UK based
          hosting regions where available.

      <section class="card">
        <h2>How long we keep your data</h2>
        <p>
          Retention periods are usually set by your institution’s assessment and
          quality assurance policies.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            AI session logs and AI Index files are generally kept for at least
            the duration of the module and any academic appeals period.
          </li>
          <li>
            System logs used for security and performance monitoring may be kept
            for shorter periods.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Data may be anonymised and kept for longer for reporting, statistical
          and service improvement purposes. Once anonymised it will no longer be
          possible to identify you from that data.

            you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to request erasure in some circumstances, for example where
            data is no longer needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to restrict or object to certain types of processing,
            especially where based on legitimate interests.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to data portability for information you have provided, where
            processing is based on consent or contract and is carried out by
            automated means.

          We use technical and organisational measures to protect your data,
          including encryption in transit, access controls, audit logs and
          regular monitoring of the Service. No online service can be completely
