        <h1>Terms of use</h1>
        <p class="muted">Last updated: 27 November 2025</p>
        <p>
          These Terms of Use govern your access to and use of the Wurksy AI web
          application and related services (the “Service”). By accessing or
          using the Service you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, you
          must not use the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Wurksy AI is provided through your university or college, these
          terms work alongside your institution’s regulations, academic
          integrity policies and IT acceptable use policies. If there is any
          conflict, your institution’s rules take priority.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Purpose of Wurksy AI</h2>
        <p>
          Wurksy AI is designed as a controlled AI “sandbox” for learning and
          assessment support, particularly for assessments where limited AI use
          is permitted. It helps students use AI in a transparent way and
          provides staff with an auditable record of AI usage.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            The Service is intended for scaffolding, feedback and exploration.
          </li>
          <li>
            You remain responsible for your own work, reasoning and academic
            judgement.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must always follow the specific AI rules set for each
            assignment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Who may use the Service</h2>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            Students and staff at participating institutions who have been given
            access to Wurksy AI.
          </li>
          <li>
            Individuals authorised by the Operator for demonstration or pilot
            purposes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old or meet the age requirement set by
          your institution, and you must only access the Service using your own
          institutional account or an account that has been assigned to you.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Your responsibilities</h2>
        <p>When you use the Service you agree that you will:</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            Comply with your institution’s academic integrity and assessment
            rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Wurksy AI only in the way allowed for each assignment, for
            example within prompt limits, output limits and policy banners.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carefully review any AI generated content and never submit AI output
            as if it were entirely your own work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not attempt to bypass, disable or interfere with any logging,
            restrictions or integrity features in the Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not use the Service to generate or share content that is unlawful,
            discriminatory, harassing, misleading or otherwise inappropriate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not upload or share confidential information that you are not
            authorised to disclose.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid entering highly sensitive personal data about yourself or
            others unless your institution has clearly instructed you to do so.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Academic integrity</h2>
        <p>
          Your institution may use Wurksy AI logs and AI Index files to support
          academic integrity reviews and investigations.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            Staff may review your AI usage alongside your submitted work to
            check that you followed the assessment rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attempts to hide or misrepresent your use of AI may be treated as
            academic misconduct.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are responsible for understanding how AI is allowed for each
            task. If you are unsure, you must ask your module leader or tutor
            before using the Service.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Acceptable use</h2>

          <li>Break any law or regulation or encourage others to do so.</li>
          <li>
            Infringe the intellectual property rights or privacy rights of
            others.

          <li>
            Reverse engineer, copy, resell or provide the Service to others
            without permission.
          </li>
          <li>
            Train competing models or build a competing service using access to
            Wurksy AI.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Service availability and changes</h2>
        <p>
          Wurksy AI is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We aim
          to provide a reliable service but we do not guarantee that it will be
          uninterrupted, secure or free from errors.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>
          The Wurksy AI platform, including its design, code, databases and
          documentation, is protected by intellectual property rights owned or
          licensed by the Operator.

        <p>
          You are granted a limited, non exclusive, non transferable licence to
          use the Service for your own learning, teaching or assessment work
          while you have an active account. You may not copy, modify,

          allowed by law or with written permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subject to your institution’s regulations, you normally own the

          keep copies of AI logs and AI Index files for academic integrity and
          quality assurance purposes.

      <section class="card">
        <h2>AI generated content</h2>
        <p>
          AI models can sometimes produce inaccurate, incomplete or biased
          responses. They may also generate content that looks convincing but is
          wrong. You must:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            Check facts and references before relying on them in your work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use AI suggestions as a starting point, not as a final answer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apply your own critical thinking, subject knowledge and academic
            judgement.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Neither the Operator nor your institution can promise that AI
          generated content will be accurate, complete or suitable for any
          particular purpose.

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          Nothing in these terms limits or excludes any liability that cannot be
          limited or excluded under applicable law, such as liability for death
          or personal injury caused by negligence or for fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subject to that, the Operator and any participating institution will
          not be liable for:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            Loss of marks, grades or academic outcomes that result from your use
            or misuse of the Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any indirect, consequential or special loss, including loss of
            opportunity or loss of data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any loss or damage that could not reasonably have been foreseen when
            you started using the Service.

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Suspension and termination</h2>
        <p>
          Your access to Wurksy AI may be suspended or terminated by your
          institution or by the Operator if:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            You breach these terms or your institution’s rules, especially
            around academic integrity or acceptable use.
          </li>
          <li>Your course enrolment or employment ends.</li>
          <li>
            The Service is withdrawn, or the pilot or licence comes to an end.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Suspension or termination of access does not remove your obligation to
          cooperate with any ongoing academic or disciplinary processes.

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Changes to these terms</h2>

          We may update these terms from time to time. If changes are
          significant, we will take reasonable steps to draw them to your
          attention, for example through notices in the Service or via your
          institution. By continuing to use the Service after changes take
          effect, you agree to the updated terms.
